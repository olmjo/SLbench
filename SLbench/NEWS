Version 0.2-0
-------------

        * No backwards compatibility with version 0.1-0.

        * Added new tests based on statistical estimation 
          of strategic games, generic statistical methods 
          from the MASS package, and Bayesian MCMC ideal
          point estimation.

        * Removed poorly designed tests and unnecessary 
          code.
